   "Habit": "Spreads readily to form groundcover. Works well in woodland settings or as a lawn alternative in shaded areas.",
   "Habit over Time": "Creates expanding patches through both rhizomes and prolific self-seeding. While it can spread enthusiastically in optimal conditions, its low stature prevents it from overwhelming taller neighbors. The heart-shaped leaves form an effective groundcover that allows spring ephemerals to grow through.",
   "Habitat Associations": "Woodland Edge/Prairie Edge: Adaptable groundcover that grows in various light conditions. Pairs well with spring ephemerals in woodlands and with prairie plants in sunnier areas.",
